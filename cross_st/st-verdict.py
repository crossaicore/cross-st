## st-verdict — Which AI wrote the most accurate stories, and why

Renders a stacked verdict bar chart that answers the three key questions:
**which AI author produced the best stories**, which produced the worst,
and **why** — backed by the True / ~True / Opinion / ~False / False breakdown
from the full cross-product fact-check matrix.  Run st-cross first.

Defaults: --display and --ai-short are ON.  Suppress with --no-display / --no-ai-short.

```
st-verdict subject.json                            # display chart + short caption (default)
st-verdict --no-ai-short subject.json              # display chart only, no caption
st-verdict --file subject.json                     # display + short caption + save PNG to ./tmp/
st-verdict --ai-caption subject.json               # display + full caption instead of short
st-verdict --no-display --file subject.json        # save PNG to ./tmp/ only, no screen
st-verdict --file --ai-title --agent gemini s.json    # save PNG + title via gemini
st-verdict --what-is-false --ai-summary s.json     # focused breakdown of inaccurate claims (story 1)
st-verdict --what-is-true  --ai-caption  s.json    # focused breakdown of verified claims (story 1)
st-verdict --what-is-missing --ai-summary s.json   # what important aspects the report omitted (story 1)
st-verdict --how-to-fix s.json                     # recommend next action: st-fix / st-bang / st-merge / publish
st-verdict -s 2 --what-is-false --ai-summary s.json # analyse story 2 instead of the default story 1
```

Input:  subject.json  — populated story container (run st-cross first)
Output: chart on screen (--display) and/or PNG saved to --path (default ./tmp/)

Options: --display / --no-display   --file  --path
         --ai-title  --ai-short / --no-ai-short  --ai-caption  --ai-summary  --ai-story
         --what-is-false  --what-is-true  --what-is-missing  --how-to-fix

(word/segment compliance) + Accuracy (volume-weighted with min-claim floor)
+ Calibration (cohort-relative opinion share). The PRE-COMPUTED WINNER
section below is authoritative — do NOT recompute or override it.

CRITICAL RULE: When you name the "best AI" or "winner", you MUST pick from

only appears in the FACT-CHECK EVALUATORS list) as the winning author —
those AIs judged the work, they did not author it.

HOW TO READ THIS CHART:
• Each bar represents one story author (target AI).
• The bar is stacked by verdict category — the colour bands show what fraction of
  that author's claims were True / ~True / Opinion / ~False / False on average.
• A tall green band = high accuracy.  Any red/orange band = notable inaccuracy.
• Compare bar heights to see which author generates more verifiable claims overall.
• The Opinion band is neutral — it counts claims that are subjective, not wrong.

THE KEY QUESTION TO ANSWER:
Which AI author produced the most accurate, fact-verified stories on this topic,
and what in the verdict breakdown explains why?  Use the PRE-COMPUTED WINNER as
your answer; explain WHY using the four sub-scores (coverage, completeness,
accuracy, calibration) and the verdict bands.
